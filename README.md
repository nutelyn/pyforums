# pyforums
## background
finally i've reached internship arc, but i've been looking at how there's no work to be done in my office... i mean i do work in security as a SOC Analysts and there's little to nothing to do... so i decided to create a mini project and this repository is a part of the mini project i create.

## what is this?
this is a repositories of a part of my mini project, it's called pyforums, as the name suggest it's a forum apps made with python.. this will focused on implementing the usage of python flask and sqlite3 and ofc secure coding implementation, althought i will make the unsecure version at first.. gotta make sure thing runs well.
